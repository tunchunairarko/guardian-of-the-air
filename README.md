# guardian-of-the-air

Guardian of the air is a total solution based upon crowdsourced and scientific data collection and analysis of air quality, pollution and various airborne disease symptoms. The base of the solution is an application which can provide people, especially travellers informations and guidance regarding pre-travelling and post-travelling safety precautions they need to take while travelling from one place to another. It is quite significant because whenever people move from one place to another they need to adjust with the atmosphere and environment of that area. Sometimes in this adjusting process they get caught with various diseases. By using our app people can get information regarding the destination city, its current air condition, dust condition, sustainability, weather information and safety guideline about how they need to take precaution. For advanced users the app also provides detailed analysis of the crowdsourced data, its comparison with the real data collected via aqicn.org. Also comparison of the air related data with the symptoms can be seen by the app.

The data collection method for crowdsource data has been made unique for the app. Regular surveys take long listing informations and forms to be filled up by the provider. In return many a times they don't get accredition for their work or can't see the output of their survey. Guardian of the air does not force people to participate in survey, rather they let people get attracted to the survey panel via an interactive puzzle solving game. A simple questionnaire game which collects generalized data about the air and atmosphere of that area from the user, including various airborne disease and their symptom information. The system accredits each contributors as "Air Guardian". Guardians contribute to the community, while they also receive points for their contribution. Basing on their points earned, a global leaderboard is displayed where their work is displayed. Also, their contribution is shared via facebook groups and other social media.

Apart from interactive data input system, the app is also providing people to browse Nasa GIBS worldview API for google map to see plotted data of carbon monoxide, nitrogen di oxide, sulphur di oxide and air quality index via the app.

The solution also provides an interfacing system to incorporate various air parameter measurement devices to connect with the app and collect real time air data. In this context, our solution also provides a device named "Blue Lantern" which can collect data of dust particle, carbon monoxide, carbon di oxide and sulphur di oxide in real time via sensors. This feature can be used by various researchers and scientists to collect data and analyze them with the app.
